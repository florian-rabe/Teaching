Option 1: lightweight approach - compile yourself

- Install a JVM.
- Download the scala compiler (which should include the file scala-library.jar)
- Use the scala compiler to compile all sources in src/ to a folder bin/.

Then run the program as
 
 java -classpath bin:PATH/TO/scala-library.jar language.Main test.sads main
  
(On windows, use ; instead of :)

This should call the 'main' method of 'language.Main' using the arguments ["test.sads", "main"]



Option 2: heavyweight approach - use an IDE

- Intall an IDE that supports Scala, i.e., Eclipse or IntelliJ.
- Install the Scala plugin for your IDE if it does not come bundled with it.
- Create a new project from this folder.
- Run 'language.Main' using command line arguments ["test.sads", "main"]



Option 3: extremely lightweight approach - use an online IDE

Copy all files into an online IDE that supports Scala and run it from there.

Just search for "online IDE" - there are many. Some of them can even import projects from github.
