   % security protocol correctness, such as key management protocol correctness,
   % e.g., going back to the work by Burrows, Abadi, and Needham on a logic of authentication (https://doi.org/10.1145/77648.77649)
   % Its an application of logic to a concrete problem space where errors are obviously bad.
