There are several major research clusters in program synthesis including the following.

The B-Method\footnote{\url{http://www.methode-b.com/}} refers to a family of France-centered synthesis tools.
A major success story was the verification of a critical software component in Paris's metro line 14\footnote{\url{http://www.methode-b.com/documentation_b/ClearSy-Industrial_Use_of_B.pdf}}.

The Kestrel institute\footnote{\url{http://www.kestrel.edu/}} has developed a number of synthesis tools.
A major case study was the synthesis of a garbage collection tool implementation\footnote{\url{ftp://www.kestrel.edu/pub/papers/smith/MPC10.pdf}}.

The Bird-Meertens Formalism\footnote{\url{https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/3390/PRG69.pdf}} is a set of definitions and notations designed to efficiently treat functions as objects such that specifications can be rewritten into efficiently executable definitions using algebraic methods.
