A protocol is an algorithm that involves multiple parties that exchange messages.
The programs implementing the various parties usually run on different machines, and messages are exchanged over a network.
Notably, all parties must implement the protocol specification independently, possibly in different programming languages.

A typical example is the HTTP protocol between two parties called \textbf{client} and \textbf{server}.
The client sends an HTTP request to the server, and then the server sends an HTTP response back to the client.

For example, retrieving an HTML page usually uses the HTTP protocol (or its encrypted variant HTTPS).
Here the client is the web browser, and the server is the web server.
