\title{Lectures Notes on Knowledge Representation and Processing}
\author{Florian Rabe and Michael Kohlhase}
\date{2020}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\bigskip

These notes were originally prepared for our CS course at University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) in Summer 2020.
They are directed at 3rd semester CS undergraduates and master students but should be intelligible even for earlier students and could be interesting also for PhD students and for students from adjacent majors.
The course is recommended both as a first course in the specialization area Artificial Intelligence as well as a one-off overview on on knowledge representation.

The course was developed in Summer 2020 from scratch and materials were built along the way.
It integrated current directions and recent results in research on knowledge representation pulling together materials in an entirely new and original way.
