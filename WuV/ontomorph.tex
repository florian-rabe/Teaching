%Consider the following test
%
%vocabulary in BOL by example
%
%domain vocabulary:
%Old =
%  concept man
%  concept woman
%  axiom a1: man union woman = top
%  axiom a2: man inter woman = empty
%
%codomain vocabulary (still to be worked out, supposed to represent transgender change):
%New =
%  concept cisman
%  concept transman
%  concept ciswoman
%  concept transwoman
%  axiom ...
%
%vocabulary morphism m maps every domain symbol to corresponding codomain expression
%actually: maps every domain declaration to a corresponding codomain expression
%
%in particular: axiom establishing F is mapped to a proof of m(F)
%  works best if we
%    * give names to the axioms
%    * extend the language with proof expressions
%
%Morphism m : V -> W
%induces compositional mapping of V-expression E to W-expressions m(E)
%by replacing every reference to a V-symbol s with the W-expression assigned to s by m, i.e., the expression e such that s:=e in s in m
%
%Exactly like for substitutions, but acting on the language symbols instead of the variables.
