1) Implement well-formedness for BOL, i.e.,

  // |-  V
  fun wfv(V: Vocabulary): Boolean =
   // for each declaration, check relative to the vocabulary containing only the previous declarations
       - that the name (if any) is new
       - any expressions occurring in the declaration are well-formed (for BOL: only the case for axioms)

  // |-_V f: Formula
  fun wff(V: Vocabulary, f: Formula): Boolean
  // 7 times, one each for Concept, Individual, Relation, Formula, Property, BaseType, BaseValue
      (omit Property, BaseType, BaseValue in first version)

2) Implement well-formedness for SFOL, i.e.,
  Context = List VarDecl
  VarDecl = Id * Type

  // |-  V
  fun wfv(V: Vocabulary): Boolean =
   // for each declaration, check relative to the vocabulary containing only the previous declarations
       - that the name (if any) is new
       - any expressions occurring in the declaration are well-formed

  // |-_V f: Formula
  fun wff(V: Vocabulary, g: Context, f: Formula): Boolean = {
    match f
    | Forall(x,tp,bd) => wft(V,g,tp) && wff(V, g.append((x,tp)), bd)
    | ...
  }
  fun wfy(V: Vocabulary, g: Context, y: Type): Boolean
  // return None if ill-formed, the inferred type otherwise
  fun wft(V: Vocabulary, g: Context, t: Term): Option[Type] =
    match t
    | Variable(x) => // find x in g and return its type
    | ...
  }

3) (Try to) implement an absolute deductive semantics for BOL, i.e., a theorem prover
   
    // |-_V f
   istheorem(V: Vocabulary, f: Formula): Boolean =
     // try to derive |- f using the rules from the slides
     // general problem: very difficult search problem, not a straightforward inductive function
     // but maybe doable for BOL 
     // hint: strip down the BOL syntax to the bare essentials and start with that
           e.g., no properties, only atomic relations, only atomic concepts
    // maybe implement two versions: with and without induction
