SFOL -> TPTP

TPTP is just a different syntax for SFOL, so this is essentially a printer, not really a translation
http://www.tptp.org/TPTP/SyntaxBNF.html

formulas
[[F /\ G]] = [[F]] + "&" + [[G]]
[[forall X:a.F]] = "![" + X + ":" + [[a]] + "]:" + [[F]]

declarations:
[[type y]] = "tff(y_decl, type,"+ y +":$tType)."
[[fun f: Y_1,...,Y_n->Y]] = "tff(f_decl, type, f:" + [[Y_1]] +"*" + ... + [[Y_n]] + ">" + [[Y]] + ")."
[[pred p: Y_1,...,Y_n]] = "tff(p_decl, type, f:" + [[Y_1]] +"*" + ... + [[Y_n]] + ">" + "$o" + ")."
[[axiom F]] = "tff(axiom_1, axiom, [[F]] + ")."
 

SFOL provers use TPTP as input language, e.g., Vampire, E, Spass.
See the annual competition at http://www.tptp.org/CASC/

When called with an additional "declaration", which acts as the query,
tff(conj, conjecture, F)
the theorem prover tries to prove F from the axioms.

Exercise on Tuesday: translate Uni ontology BOL->SFOL->TPTP, then use SFOL provers to prove BOL theorems

A set of datatypes for the TPTP syntax may be overkill, but using a datatype for TPTP declarations like below can be helpful.
enum Role = axiom | type | conjecture
class TFF(name:String, role: Role, formula: String)
