2022/2023:

https://gitlab.cs.fau.de/
end a little earlier, leave room for general discussion
create simple slides, don't show notes

2023/2024:

use 2 exercise sessions without new task to allow catching up, one at half-time
make everybody use the same language, at least for the later exercises (most groups switched to whatever language I gave examples in)
