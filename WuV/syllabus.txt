Exercises were done mostly during the scheduled time slot, often as team tasks, possibly refined in homeworks.
Where appropriate, the instructor acted both as a customer giving vague problems and an advisor giving hints how to solve them.

The slides are almost complete. Only a few sessions made use of the lecture notes.
These were in particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item the section on syntax
\item the definitions of BOL, SFOL, and the translation BOL$\to$ SFOL
\end{itemize}
